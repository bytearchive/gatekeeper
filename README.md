Leonard, the gatekeeper

Place Leonard in charge of your appartment key pad. When you punch in the code, Leonard will answer and let you in. You just have to text him ahead of time to let him know that you are coming.

Instructions:

Setup:
1. Find Leonard a nice home on EC2, Rackspace, or Heroku.
1. Set up a Twilio number
1. Configure Leonard with the Twilio account as well as which numbers should be whitelisted.
1. Have your landlord connect your door code to Leonard

Daily Use:

1. Text Leonard ahead of time and let him know you are on your way
2. Within 5 minutes, dial the door code.
3. Leonard will answer and let you in.

Extras:
- If you aren't whitelisted, Leonard can still let you in if you text him the secret password.
- Leonard will foward unknown users to your phone, just like before.
- Party Mode: Leonard will let everyone in!
- Access Log so you can see who is coming and going

Wouldn't it be nice:
- If Leonard had a web interface
- There was an EC2 AMI
- Verify that it is Twilio hitting the SMS endpoint

Security:

So how secure is this? Let's just say the NSA shouldn't use this. Neither should Fort Knox.
